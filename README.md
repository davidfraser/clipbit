*Children Learn Intuitive Programming By Inconvenient Typing*

Background
----------

Many programmers today started programming because as children they had access to one of the early home computers. These typically comprised of a keyboard which also contained the CPU, memory etc, and an output that connected to a TV. Significantly, they didn't come loaded with existing programs, but you could get books and magazines with program code listings. By typing these into the computer, you could make it operate. Through the act of typing in these programs, experiencing what they did, and having to correct any mistakes, children were aware of the underlying code and began to form an intuitive understanding of what it meant.

Nowadays, many readily available electronic devices including cell phones (even the basic ones),  contain processors more powerful than those computers. However the trend towards ease of use has meant that there is no exposure to code. This means that children are missing out on a potential gold mine of explorative learning.

Goal
----

The goal of this project is to provide a set of programs for children to type into a computer. Ideally this computer should be made available to them with *only* the ability to type in these programs. The programs should be provided ideally in a book, and they will contain minimal instructions on how to type them in, and what they do, but no traditional instruction in how computer programs work. That can be provided to them as they ask questions or struggle with things that they are trying to create themselves

Nature of programs
------------------

The programs should be:

* As simple to type as possible (i.e. lean towards short variable/function names)
* Fun for children to interact with
* Ideally good examples of logically structured programs
