This is a book of programs that you can type into a computer. They do some quite cool and fun things; you can also change them to do other interesting things or make your own programs!

Typing in Programs
------------------

When you are typing these programs, be careful to write them exactly as they are written. This includes things like whether you have a small letter ``b`` or a capital ``B``, and the punctuation marks like ``!@#$%^&*()`` are a very important part of the program that need to go in the right place too! In Python, having the right number of spaces at the start of the line is very important so make sure you copy that carefully.
