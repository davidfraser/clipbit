Secret Codes
============

You can use this program to send secret messages to a friend who also has it,
and they can use it to decode the messages so they can understand them.

To get this to work, enter a message and then a number between ``1`` and ``25`` (like ``3``).
You will then receive a secret code for that message!
To decode the message, you need to put in the secret code you got out,
and then make the number a *minus* the first number you put in (like ``-3``).
