Secret Codes
============

You can use this program to send secret messages to a friend who also has it,
and they can use it to decode the messages so they can understand them.

To get this to work, enter a message and then a number between ``0`` and ``7905853580625``
You will then receive a secret code for that message!
To decode the message, you need to put in the secret code you got out, with the *same*
number as you put in. If you put in a different number, you will get a different answer!
