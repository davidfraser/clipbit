This is a book of programs that you can type into a computer.
They do some quite cool and fun things;
you can also change them to do other interesting things
or make your own programs!

Typing in Programs
------------------

When you are typing these programs, be careful to write them exactly as they are written.
This includes: 

 * whether you have a small letter ``b`` or a capital ``B``
 * the punctuation marks like ``+ - * / % < > & | ^ ~ = ! ( ) [ ] { } @ , : . ` ; ' " # \``
 * the number of spaces at the start of each line -
   make sure your line startings line up just like they do in the printed version!

So if you have trouble running your programs, check that you have typed them exactly correctly.
