Secret Codes
============

To get this to work, enter a message and then a number between ``1`` and ``25`` (like ``3``).
You will then receive a secret code for that message!
To decode the message, you need to put in the secret code you got out,
and then make the number a *minus* the first number you put in (like ``-3``).
You can use this to decode a secret code you get from a friend...
